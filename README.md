#### Code Snippet
Client side JavaScript to call the upload widget and retrive unique image URL from the response object. 

```
var photoURL;

var myWidget = cloudinary.createUploadWidget({
    cloudName: cloudName,
    uploadPreset: uploadPresent,
    }, (error, result) => {
        if (!error && result && result.event === "success") {
            const location_id = document.querySelector("#user-location").getAttribute("data-location");
            console.log('Done! Here is the image info: ', result.info);
            photoURL = result.info.url;
            };
